Install Terraform on your local machine by following the official documentation.
(https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration and create a new file named "main.tf".

Initialize the Azure provider.

Define the resource group where you want to create the TrueNAS virtual machine.

Create a virtual network for the virtual machine.

Create a Subnet for the virtual network.

Create a Subnet NIC virtual machine.

Build the VM block for TrueNAS

az login
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
az role assignment create --assignee <app-registration-object-id> --role <role-name> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>



Project Notes:

This Terraform script creates an Azure resource group, storage account, virtual network, subnet, network interface, and virtual machine using the Azure provider for Terraform. The script has some input variables such as prefix, resource_group_location, and resource_vnet that are defined in the variables.tf file.

The az commands at the beginning are setting the Azure subscription and assigning a role to the app registration that will be used in this script.

The provider and terraform blocks are defining the Azure provider version to be used and the authentication credentials to be used to access the Azure subscription. In this case, service principal credentials are used.

The resources to be created are defined using the resource blocks, with each resource having its own set of properties. Each resource has a unique name and is associated with the resource group created earlier.

The script creates a virtual machine using a TrueNAS image from the ixsystems publisher. It has an OS disk and is located in a subnet with a specified IP address range.

To use this Terraform script, you will need to have Terraform installed on your computer and the Azure CLI. You will also need to authenticate with the Azure subscription using the Azure CLI or other methods, such as providing the credentials directly in the Terraform script.

To push the script to a Git repository, you can create a new repository in GitHub, initialize a new repository on your local machine, add the script files to the local repository, commit the changes, and then push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Here are the basic steps to follow:

Create a new repository on GitHub and copy the repository URL.
On your local machine, navigate to the directory where you want to store the Terraform script.
Run git init to initialize a new Git repository.
Add the Terraform script files to the local repository using git add.
Commit the changes using git commit.
Set the remote repository URL using git remote add origin <repository-url>.
Push the changes to the remote repository using git push -u origin main.
With these steps, the Terraform script will be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.
